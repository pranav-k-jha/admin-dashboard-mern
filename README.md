# Admin Dashboard in MERN Stack

This project involves building an Admin Dashboard using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. The frontend will be developed using Material UI, Material UI Data Grid, Nivo Charts, Redux Toolkit, and Redux Toolkit Query. The backend will utilize Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose, and MongoDB. Additionally, the project will cover data modeling using Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and making aggregate calls in MongoDB.
